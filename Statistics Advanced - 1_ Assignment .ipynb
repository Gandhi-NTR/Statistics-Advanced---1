What is a random variable in probability theory?\n","\n","- A random variable in probability theory is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random experiment or event.\n","\n","- There are two types:\n","\n","* Discrete random variable - takes a finite or countable set of values, such as the number of heads in three coin tosses\n","* Continuous random variable - can take any value within a range, such as the height of students in a class.\n","2. What are the types of random variables?\n","- There are mainly two types of random variables in probability theory:\n","- Discrete random variable - Takes a finite or countable number of possible values. Examples: number of goals in a football match, number of students present in class.\n","- Continuous random variable - Takes an infinite number of possible values within a given range or interval. Examples: temperature in a city, height of people, time taken to finish a race.\n","3. Explain the difference between discrete and continuous distributions.\n","- A discrete distribution describes the probabilities of outcomes of a discrete random variable. The values are separate and countable. Example: probability distribution of rolling a die (values 1 to 6). The probabilities are listed for each distinct outcome, and their sum equals 1.\n","- A continuous distribution describes the probabilities of outcomes of a continuous random variable. The values can take any point in a range, so probabilities are represented using a curve (probability density function) instead of a simple list. Example: distribution of heights in a population. The probability of getting an exact value is zero; instead, we talk about the probability within an interval.\n","4. What is a binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n","- A binomial distribution is a type of probability distribution that summarizes the likelihood of getting a fixed number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes — success or failure — and the probability of success remains constant.\n","- It is used in situations such as:\n","\n","-  Predicting the number of heads when flipping a coin multiple times\n","-  Estimating the number of defective items in a batch\n","-  Calculating the probability of a certain number of people agreeing in a survey\n","\n","- The formula for the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is:\n","\n","- **P(X = k) = C(n, k) × p^k × (1 − p)^(n − k)**\n","- where:\n","- n = number of trials\n","- k = number of successes\n","- p = probability of success in one trial\n","- C(n, k) = combination of n items taken k at a time\n","5. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n","- The standard normal distribution is a special type of normal distribution that has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Its shape is a symmetric bell curve centered at zero.\n","- It is important because:\n","- It allows us to easily compare different normal distributions by converting values into z-scores (standardized values).\n","-  Tables and software for the standard normal make probability calculations easier.\n","- Many real-world phenomena follow or approximate a normal distribution, so standardizing helps in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.\n","6. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?\n","- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that when independent random samples are taken from any population with a finite mean and variance, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the original population’s distribution.\n","- It is critical because:\n","* It justifies using normal probability methods (like z-tests and t-tests) even when the original data is not normally distributed\n","* It enables statistical inference for population parameters using sample statistics\n","* It provides the theoretical foundation for many statistical procedures in research and data analysis\n","- A common rule of thumb is that a sample size of 30 or more is usually enough for the CLT to give a good normal approximation.\n","7. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n","- A confidence interval is a range of values, calculated from sample data, that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain level of confidence (such as 95% or 99%).\n","- Its significance in statistical analysis is:\n","* It provides an estimate of the parameter along with the margin of error, instead of just a single point estimate\n","* It reflects the uncertainty of the estimate, helping in better decision-making\n","* A wider interval suggests more uncertainty, while a narrower interval suggests more precision\n","* It is widely used in research, surveys, and quality control to express how reliable the results are\n","- **Example:** A 95% confidence interval for a population mean of (48, 52) means we are 95% confident the true mean lies between 48 and 52.\n","8. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n","- The expected value in a probability distribution is the long-run average or mean value you would expect to get if you repeated an experiment many times under the same conditions.\n","- For a discrete random variable, it is calculated as:\n","- **E(X) = Σ \\[x × P(x)]**\n","- where:\n","- x = each possible value of the random variable\n","- P(x) = probability of that value occurring\n","- For a continuous random variable, it is found using an integral instead of a sum.\n","- It is important because it gives a single number summarizing the “center” of the distribution and is used in decision-making, risk assessment, and statistical analysis.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"kE25Y4sy-dU8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.
